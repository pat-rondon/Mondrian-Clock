This is a program for generating Mondrian-style pictures; it also
happens to function as a (terrible) clock.

The time is displayed as follows:
  Hours mod 6:  # red squares * # black squares
  Minutes / 10: # blue squares * # yellow squares

Seriously, don't try to use this as your only clock.

To compile, just run 

  ocamlbuild clock.native

Then run

  ./clock.native

Press 'q' to quit, 'r' to regenerate the picture.
